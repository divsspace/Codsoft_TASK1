#TASK1

This project was undertaken for an internship under CODSOFT, requiring the completion of 3 tasks based on Java Programming.

The program is a number guessing game. The system generates any random number between 0 to 100. The users are allowed 5 attempts to guess the number.

After each guess, the system displays the message whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the generated number.

After each win or loss, a score is displayed based on the number of rounds and attempts. A user may start another round, or exit the game after a win or a loss.
